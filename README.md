# Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for Brain tumor Image Classification

## Overview

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras for image classification. The goal is to classify images into different categories based on the presence of pituitary tumors. The model architecture and hyperparameters are explored using a grid search.

## Libraries Used

- TensorFlow 1.15.2
- Keras
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

## Setup

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy scikit-learn
Dataset
The dataset is assumed to be in the form of pickled files:

X_train.pickle: Training images
Y_train.pickle: Training labels
X_test.pickle: Testing images
Y_test.pickle: Testing labels
Model Architecture Exploration
The code explores different combinations of hyperparameters for the CNN model, including the number of convolutional layers, nodes per layer, and dense layers. The results are printed, and the best-performing models are saved.

Hyperparameters Explored
Convolutional Layers: [1, 2, 3]
Nodes per Convolutional Layer: [32, 64, 128]
Dense Layers: [0, 1, 2]
Running the Code
Upload your dataset pickle files (X_train.pickle, Y_train.pickle, X_test.pickle, Y_test.pickle) to the same directory as the code.

Execute the notebook/script.

Model Training and Evaluation
The code trains the CNN models with different hyperparameters and evaluates their performance on the test set. The models are saved with a unique identifier based on the hyperparameters and accuracy.

TensorBoard and Early Stopping
TensorBoard is utilized for visualizing the training process. Early stopping is implemented to prevent overfitting.

Results
The results, including accuracy, loss, and classification reports, are printed during and after training. The best-performing models are saved.
